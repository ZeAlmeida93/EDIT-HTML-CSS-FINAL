# EDIT-HTML-CSS-FINAL
Repository for Final project in HTML - EDIT (2024)


This is the final project for my HTML-CSS module.

It's a concept online store made up of 3 pages.

Main Goals:


#1 --> Develop a good HTML that's able to access to whole styling structure.
#2 --> Create my stylesheet using SASS and prioritize custom properties and variables, analyzing my Figma Layout first and understanding what components and properties should i set in my root directory

Link to my figma layout --> https://www.figma.com/design/ceCZJnNDjqU0u69Y31adJt/Edit---Loja-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=zcF9fDrMV155jl4c-1

#3 --> Export and Organize assets from my figma file.Mostly images and videos and understand and what different sizes are needed to create my data-sets in order to enhance my webpage in terms of performance.

#4 --> Set a "Mobile-First" approach. How? --> Maybe by starting first with the smallest breakpoints.
